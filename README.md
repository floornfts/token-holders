## Why share with Floor holders?
The Floor community is among the longest standing, and most active communities in web3. Our early token holders stand-out even in this group as dedicated, and well-known collectors.

* $100s of millions of trading volume
* Dozens of prominent NFT collectors
* Overall a positive, and long-term oriented outlook!

## Snapshots
Snapshots happen every Friday night @ 11:59:59pm UTC.

At each snapshot:
* `latest.csv` and `latest_genX.csv` are replaced by the current state of the snapshot.
* `/snapshots` will get a new folder added for `YYYY-MM-DD-holders` with `all.csv` as well as `genX.csv` for each generation
